#Set the maximum number of friends to add to the list is 4
#Create an Input asks for the name of the person you want to add to the list

#After adding the name, a message will be printed with it stating that you have converted the first letter into a capital letter
#The name of the person must be printed with the letter of addition
#If the person has written a name and the first letter in it is capitalized, add it directly and type a message stating the addition
#In the event that the name has been added and there is still another place in the list, show the Input to add another name until the list is filled
#With each addition, write a message stating how many names are left in the list before it becomes full
#Each name that is added must remove the spaces before and after it, if any
